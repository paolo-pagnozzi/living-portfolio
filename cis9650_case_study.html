    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Project Overview</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">In the Programming for Analytics course, teams were asked to build a Jupyter Notebook application that used Python to explore and analyze a dataset of their choice.  
      Our team selected a public dataset on population and economic indicators from the <em>World Bank</em>, which covered several decades across dozens of countries.  
      The goal was to examine how GDP and life expectancy have evolved over time and to identify interesting relationships between economic growth and public health.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">Key requirements from the project brief included:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
      <li>Download and document the chosen dataset, citing its source and licensing.</li>
      <li>Formulate clear research questions and hypotheses.</li>
      <li>Load the data using <code>pandas</code> and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).</li>
      <li>Clean and transform the data for analysis.</li>
      <li>Create visualizations with <code>matplotlib</code> or <code>seaborn</code> that answer the research questions.</li>
      <li>Draw conclusions and discuss implications for stakeholders.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="mb-10">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Data Loading &amp; Cleaning</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">We used <code>pandas</code> to download the World Bank CSV file, inspect its columns, and handle missing values.  
      A separate <code>DataFrame</code> was created for each indicator (GDP per capita and life expectancy), and these were merged on country and year.  
      Data cleaning included filtering out countries with too few observations, forward filling missing years, and converting units to make the metrics comparable.</p>
    <pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded text-sm overflow-x-auto"><code># Import libraries
import pandas as pd

# Load GDP and life expectancy datasets
url_gdp = "https://example.com/world_bank_gdp.csv"
url_life = "https://example.com/world_bank_life_expectancy.csv"

gdp = pd.read_csv(url_gdp)
life = pd.read_csv(url_life)

# Keep only relevant columns and rename for clarity
gdp = gdp[['Country Name', 'Country Code', 'Year', 'GDP per capita']].rename(columns={'GDP per capita': 'gdp_per_capita'})
life = life[['Country Name', 'Country Code', 'Year', 'Life expectancy at birth (years)']].rename(columns={'Life expectancy at birth (years)': 'life_expectancy'})

# Merge on country and year
data = pd.merge(gdp, life, on=['Country Name', 'Country Code', 'Year'], how='inner')

# Forward fill missing values and drop rows with remaining NaNs
data = data.sort_values(['Country Code', 'Year']).groupby('Country Code').fillna(method='ffill').dropna()
</code></pre>
  </section>
  <section class="mb-10">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Exploratory Analysis</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">After cleaning the data, we performed exploratory analysis to understand trends.  
      We began by plotting GDP per capita and life expectancy over time for select countries, and then used scatter plots to explore the relationship between these variables.</p>
    <pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded text-sm overflow-x-auto"><code>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Scatter plot of GDP vs Life Expectancy
plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
plt.scatter(data['gdp_per_capita'], data['life_expectancy'], alpha=0.3)
plt.title('Life Expectancy vs GDP per Capita')
plt.xlabel('GDP per Capita (USD)')
plt.ylabel('Life Expectancy (years)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
</code></pre>
    <p class="mb-4">The scatter plot shows a positive relationship: countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have longer life expectancy.  
      We also calculated correlation coefficients and used regression analysis to quantify this relationship.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="mb-10">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Results &amp; Conclusions</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Our analysis revealed that economic growth and public health are strongly linked.  
      While outliers exist, most countries follow a trend in which greater wealth supports better healthcare, nutrition and infrastructure, leading to longer life expectancy.  
      We concluded by noting that policies promoting equitable economic growth could have substantial health benefits.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">This case study highlights how Python serves as a powerful tool for data wrangling and visualization in the field of analytics.  
      It also demonstrates how the skills from CIS 9650 complement those learned in database management (for data retrieval) and statistics (for inference).</p>

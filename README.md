# Living Portfolio – Next Generation

This repository hosts Paul's living portfolio site. The site is evolving into a dynamic knowledge system that reflects Paul's thinking and growth. The next-generation design aims to:

- Present the site as a living system with an interactive knowledge graph linking projects, notes, and ideas.
- Replace traditional navigation with a narrative flow (Inputs → Processing → Outputs → Evolution).
- Offer an AI companion trained on Paul's README and notes for interactive Q&A and ideation.
- Provide neurodivergent-friendly design toggles for simplified or expanded views.
- Fuse data and emotion through mini dashboards, reflections, and a human performance index.
- Explore alternate persona paths through interactive cards (Parallel Pauls).
- Archive Paul's evolution by year or era in a time-capsule format.
- Use a sensory signature (ambient audio, color-coded zones: grey for logic, sand for clarity, blue for creativity).
- Host an experimental sandbox for rotating prototypes.
- Finish each narrative arc with a minimal, reflective statement.
